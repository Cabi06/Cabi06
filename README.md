**Hi, I'm Calvin!**
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MSc in Neurocognitive Psychology (LMU Munich)

Aspiring PhD researcher in Neuroscience (sleep, memory, dementia, animal models)

Data scientist in the making — working with Python, R, and Matlab for analysis & visualizations

International background: worked in Germany, Finland, Czechia, US, Brazil

Interested in brain–mind interaction, computational modeling, and translational research



**Tech & Tools I Use**
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Programming & Data: Python (Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib), R, MATLAB

Machine Learning: scikit-learn, PyTorch (LSTMs, predictive modeling)

Neurotech: EEG, TMS, tDCS, cluster-based permutation, time–frequency analysis

Other: SQL, Git, LaTeX, Jupyter Notebooks




**Featured Projects**
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Daily-Update Website**

Python + GitHub Actions site that auto-refreshes values daily.

**OSRS Price Predictor**

LSTM-based model for predicting item prices in Old School RuneScape.

**SVM for predicting schizophrenia on graymatter volume differences**

Exploring food delivery data across time and geography with Python visualizations.

**Eyetracking Thesis Analysis**

Statistical modeling (ANOVA, cluster-based permutation) for saccade frequency and memory.




**About Me**
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I love working at the intersection of cognitive neuroscience and data science — whether 
it’s using machine learning to predict behavior, applying EEG analysis to uncover memory
dynamics, or simply finding patterns in messy datasets.

Outside of research, I enjoy exploring languages (I speak 4 fluently), cooking, reading, 
and building small coding projects that automate things or visualize data. <br>

familiarity. The real foundations of his enquiry do not strike a man at all."* - Wittgenstein
